# bloggen
Sparksammy's Python3 Blog Generator used to create my blog (as of 6/13/2020)
1. Install Python3.8
2. Configure inside of bloggenpublic.py
3. Rename and edit the posts/testpost.txt to create your first post (Remember, the first line is always the title!)
4. Run launcherpublic.bat to start building your site!
  * If you are on Mac or GNU/Linux, try: python3 bloggenpublic.py
5. Maybe add a new post later by adding another text file in posts?
